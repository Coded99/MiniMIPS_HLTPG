For some reasons, the FC at 2000 ptns started giving lesser results. At the moment, trying to figure out the turining point with the amount of patterns.
QuestaSIM was able to generate dump file for 2k patterns, but not able to generate for 1800 and 1700. I had to reduce to 1600. 
Will later try 2k again to find out what happened.
