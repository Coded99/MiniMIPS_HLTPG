I noticed that the tst program for 5000 patterns was up o 30k lines, yet QuestaSIM still simulated it and produced a dump file. WHY?

E.g : In the case of Control + Random, at 150 patterns ad about 16/17k test program, QuestaSIM freezes.


*** QuestaSIM actually freezes and does not generate dump file when patterns are 8000, and test program leght is about 48785. See tst_8000.src

7000 patterns also froze --42785 lines.

5500 alsofroze. 38k-ish lines.
